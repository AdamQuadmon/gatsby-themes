### `gatsby-theme-lucifero`

This directory is the theme package itself.

- `gatsby-theme-lucifero/`
  - `gatsby-config.js`: An empty gatsby-config that you can use as a starting point for building functionality into your theme.
  - `index.js`: Since themes also function as plugins, this is an empty file that gatsby needs to use this theme as a plugin.
  - `package.json`: The dependencies that your theme will pull in when people install it. `gatsby` should be a `peerDependency`.

### `example`

This is an example usage of your theme. It should look the same as the site of someone who installed and used your theme from npm.

- `example/`
  - `gatsby-config.js`: Specifies which theme to use and any other one-off config a site might need.
  - `src/`: Source code such as one-off pages or components that might live in a user's site.

You can run the example with:

```shell
yarn workspace example develop
```
