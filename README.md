## Contents

This repository uses [Yarn Workspaces][] and [changesets][] to develop multiple packages together as a monorepo and [renovate][] to keep deps updated. Be sure to install [Yarn][] before setting up the development environment.

- `examples`: Contains the corresponding example sites for the `themes`.
- `themes`: Contains the themes themselves.
- `scripts`: Contains utils to handle stuff.

## Scripts

in the `scripts` folder:

- `mdx` - create in `csv/` folder `posts.csv`, `areas.csv`, `cagegories.csv` and `tags.csv` with mdx content from `basePath` following **area** and **topic** sections renaming topics to categories

## Tools

- [fast-csv](https://github.com/C2FO/fast-csv) - CSV parser and formatter
- [front-matter](https://github.com/jxson/front-matter) - extract YAML front matter from strings

## How to Contribute

Make sure that you have `yarn` installed on your machine (as it's mandatory for `yarn workspaces`). Fork this repository, clone it and run `yarn` in the root directory.

To launch the development server of an example site, use:

```sh
yarn workspace [examples/name] develop
```

Or for a build:

```sh
yarn workspace [examples/name] build
```

In the case of `examples/lucifero` this command would be `yarn workspace lucifero develop`. Now you can make changes to the respective theme and see them via Hot-Reloading.

Commit your changes to a feature branch of your fork and open up a PR against this repository. The PR will have checks in place which you can also run on your machine in preparation for the PR.

Have a look at the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn more.
