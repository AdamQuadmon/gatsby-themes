The term literally means **Bearer of light**, as this name derives from the Latin equivalent lucifer, composed of **lux** (light) and **ferre** (to bring), on the model of the corresponding Greek **phosphoros** (phos = light and phero = to bring), and in the context both pagan and astrological it indicates the so-called "**morning star**", that is the planet Venus visible at dawn, and is also identified with this name.

In the correspondence between Greek and Roman gods, the morning appearance of the planet Venus was personified by the mythological figure of the Greek god Phosphoros and the Latin god Lucifer.

Similarly in Egypt **Tioumoutiri** was the morning Venus. In the ancient Near East, moreover, the "morning star" coincided with **Ishtar** for the Babylonians; **Astarte** for the Phoenicians; **Inanna** for the Sumerians.

Finally, in areas of occultism and esotericism, Lucifer would be the holder of a **wisdom inaccessible to the common man**.
