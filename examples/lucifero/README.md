### 1. **Create a Gatsby site.**

Use `git` to clone the site and navigate into it:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AdamQuadmon/gatsby-starter-lucifero project-name
cd project-name
```

### 2. **Install dependencies.**

If you use npm 7 or above use the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag. If you use npm 6 you can use `npm install`.

```sh
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### 3. **Open the code and start customizing!**

Start the site by running `npm run develop`.

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

If you want to learn more about how you can use a Gatsby starter that is configured with a Gatsby theme, you can check out this [shorter](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/plugins-and-themes/using-a-gatsby-theme/) or [longer](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/using-a-theme/) tutorial. The tutorials don't exactly apply to this starter however the concepts are the same.

## üìù Using and modifying this starter

**Important Note:** Please read the guide [Shadowing in Gatsby Themes](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/plugins-and-themes/shadowing/) to understand how to customize the underlying theme!

This starter creates a new Gatsby site that installs and configures the theme [`@adamquadmon/gatsby-theme-lucifero`](https://github.com/AdamQuadmon/gatsby-themes/tree/main/themes/gatsby-theme-lucifero).

Have a look at the theme's README and files to see what options are available and how you can shadow the various components including Chakra UI. Generally speaking you will want to place your files into `src/@adamquadmon/gatsby-theme-lucifero/` to shadow/override files. The Chakra UI config can be configured by creating a theme in `src/@chakra-ui/gatsby-plugin/` or shadowing files in `src/@adamquadmon/gatsby-theme-lucifero/@chakra-ui/gatsby-plugin/`.
